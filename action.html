        <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
        <p>
          The consequences of government-subsidized cheese go far beyond what ends up on a plate. These policies have shaped eating habits, increased chronic health issues, and disproportionately affected low-income communities. But change doesn’t just happen—it’s made by people who care enough to act. Whether you're a student, educator, advocate, or concerned citizen, your voice can help shift food policy toward health, equity, and accountability. By speaking up, supporting reform efforts, and raising awareness, you can play a vital role in demanding a food system that truly serves the people.
