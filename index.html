        <h2>What is Government Cheese?</h2>
        <p>
          In the early 1980s, the U.S. government found itself with a massive surplus of cheese—hundreds of millions of pounds, purchased to support struggling dairy farmers. Rather than let it go to waste, the government distributed this cheese to low-income communities across the country. For many, it became a symbol of government aid during hard times. But beneath the surface, this seemingly generous program raised bigger questions about how our food systems are shaped—not by health needs, but by political and economic interests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, the Public Health Movement is pushing back against the legacy of government cheese. Advocates argue that the program prioritized corporate profit over community well-being, using public resources to promote a product high in saturated fat and sodium. They point to decades of lobbying by the dairy industry and government-backed marketing campaigns that helped turn cheese into an everyday dietary norm—regardless of its health consequences. This website explores how public health experts, activists, and researchers are challenging that legacy, calling for food policies that serve people, not just industries.

        <p>
          Today, health advocates argue that subsidized cheese has fueled preventable health issues like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease—especially in low-income communities that rely more heavily on these distributed foods. Although cheese consumption has declined since its peak, the impact lingers. Organizations like the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) and the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) are actively challenging government policies that continue to promote cheese as a dietary staple despite its associated health risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Critics call for updated food guidelines that de-emphasize dairy, a shift in subsidies toward healthier alternatives, and greater transparency in government-industry partnerships. For these advocates, the story of government cheese isn’t just about dairy—it’s about who our food policies are really serving. This website explores the roots of this issue and the movement demanding a healthier future for all.
