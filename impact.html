          <h2>Health Risks</h2>
          <p>Government cheese may have filled a short-term need, but its long-term impact on health has been severe. Packed with saturated fats and sodium, this processed cheese has contributed to a rise in obesity, diabetes, and heart disease—especially among the people who rely on government aid the most. Despite knowing the health risks, the government continued to promote cheese-heavy products in partnership with fast food companies, making unhealthy food more accessible than ever. The end result? A public health crisis fueled by policy choices that prioritized profit over well-being.</p>

          <h2>Uneven Impact</h2>
          <p>While wealthier families have the means to choose healthier food options, low-income communities often don’t have that luxury. For many, government cheese isn’t just a relic of the past—it’s still a dietary staple, reinforced by programs like SNAP and WIC. These communities face higher rates of obesity and related illnesses, not because of poor choices, but because of limited access to nutritious alternatives. This growing nutritional gap shows how food subsidies, when misaligned with public health goals, can deepen inequality instead of reducing it.</p>

      <!-- Section 3: The Bigger Picture -->
      <div class="w3-row" style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 64px;">
        <div class="w3-col" style="flex: 1 1 50%; padding: 16px;">
          <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
          <p>Although the overall consumption of cheese has declined, the dairy industry continues to produce in massive quantities—backed by government subsidies and aggressive marketing. Campaigns like “Got Milk?” and dairy partnerships with major chains like Domino’s and Starbucks keep cheese in the spotlight, making it hard for healthier, plant-based options to break through. These policies don’t just shape our plates; they shape our future. Until public health takes priority in food policy, we’ll keep repeating the same cycle: overproduction, aggressive promotion, and the sidelining of nutrition in favor of profit.</p>
